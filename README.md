necessary (handle categorical data, missing data and noisy data) 
3. Patten recognition analysis and Regression or Classification analysis.
4. You can use local Jupyter Notebook, cloud Kaggle or Google Colab for coding with 
analysis explanations and conclusion. (We will cover the different tools in lectures and 
tutorial sessions) 
5. Your final submission should be an ipython notebook file with well writing comments 
about your selecting dataset, analysis problems, EDA process, modelsâ€™ selection, 
evaluation, comparing discussions and conclusion.
